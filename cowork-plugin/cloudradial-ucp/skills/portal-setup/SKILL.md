# Portal Setup & Implementation Guide

Guide partners through setting up and configuring CloudRadial portals for their client companies. This covers the full implementation lifecycle — from initial portal provisioning to account management handoff.

**Important:** This skill is about configuring the CloudRadial PORTAL for a client company. For setting up the Cowork plugin and storing API credentials, use the **setup** skill instead.

## How to Call the API

All CloudRadial work goes through MCP tools served by the `cloudradial-ucp` server. The plugin auto-registers the server via `.mcp.json` — no Azure Function, no Chrome extension, no local config file.

### Before any tool call

Call `setup_status` first to confirm credentials are stored. If it returns `configured: false`, defer to the `setup` skill before doing CloudRadial work.

### Available MCP tools

| Tool | Purpose | Required args |
|------|---------|---------------|
| `setup_status` | Check credential state (never returns the keys) | — |
| `search_companies` | Search companies by partial name | `name` |
| `company_overview` | Snapshot: details, user/endpoint counts, recent articles + feedback | `company_id` |
| `list_resources` | List any of 30 resource types with OData filtering | `resource_type` |
| `count_resources` | Count a resource type with optional `filter` | `resource_type` |
| `get_resource` | Retrieve one resource by ID | `resource_type`, `id` |
| `create_resource` | Create a new resource | `resource_type`, `data` |
| `update_resource` | PUT (full) or PATCH (partial) update | `resource_type`, `id`, `data` |
| `delete_resource` | Delete by ID | `resource_type`, `id` |
| `user_lookup` | Find users by email, name, or company | one of `email`/`name`/`company_id` |
| `manage_tokens` | List, get, create, or revoke API tokens | `action` |
| `endpoint_update_warranty` | Trigger async warranty refresh by endpoint serial number | `serial_number` |
| `courseenrollment_complete` | Mark a course enrollment completed (optional score/comment) | `enrollment_id` |
| `courseenrollment_for_user` | Get a user's enrollment record for a specific course | `course_id`, `user_id` |
| `raw_api_call` | Direct API call for advanced cases | `path` |

### OData parameter conventions

For `list_resources` and `count_resources`, pass OData parameters **without** the leading `$`: `filter`, `select`, `orderby`, `top`, `skip`, `expand`, `search`. The server adds the `$` when forwarding. Page size caps at 200 — paginate with `top` + `skip`.

### Field-name quirks

- Articles use `subject` (not `title`).
- Courses use `name` (not `title`).
- `archive_item` composite key — pass `archive_id` and `id`.
- `service_install` composite key — pass `endpoint_id` and `service_id` (or `id = serviceId` on update/delete).

### Errors

- **"credentials not configured"** → defer to the `setup` skill.
- **401/403 from CloudRadial** → stored credentials are invalid. Run `setup` to rotate.
- **404** → resource not found, verify the ID.

## LOMG Framework

CloudRadial follows the **Land, Onboard, Manage, Grow** (LOMG) lifecycle. Every partner and client company is somewhere on this journey. Before doing anything, determine where they are:

| Phase | Indicators | Focus |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| **Land** | Company exists, few/no users, no articles, no endpoints | Get portal provisioned, PSA connected, first users added |
| **Onboard** | Users being added, articles being created, catalogs being configured | 5-session implementation, content seeding, ticketing integration |
| **Manage** | Consistent endpoints, regular feedback, published articles | Ongoing content updates, QBR reporting, user adoption |
| **Grow** | Courses deployed, assessments running, high engagement | Advanced features, training courses, compliance tracking, co-management |

### Assess a Company's LOMG Stage

1. Pull the company overview: call `company_overview` with `company_id: "<id>"`.

2. Count key resources:
   - Users → `count_resources?resource_type=user&filter=companyId eq <id>`
   - Endpoints → `count_resources?resource_type=endpoint&filter=companyId eq <id>`
   - Articles → `count_resources?resource_type=article&filter=companyId eq <id>`
   - Courses → `count_resources?resource_type=course&filter=companyId eq <id>`
   - Assessments → `count_resources?resource_type=assessment&filter=companyId eq <id>`
   - Feedback → `count_resources?resource_type=feedback&filter=companyId eq <id>`

3. Classify:
   - **0 endpoints + 0 articles** = Land
   - **Endpoints syncing + articles being created** = Onboard
   - **Consistent endpoints + published articles + feedback** = Manage
   - **Courses + assessments + high user count** = Grow

## The 5-Session Implementation Process

This is the standard onboarding track for new client companies. Each session has a specific focus and checklist.

### Session 1: Portal Setup & First Impressions

**Goal:** Get the portal provisioned, branded, and connected to the PSA. First users can log in.

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Company created in CloudRadial (or synced from PSA)
- [ ] Portal branding configured (logo, colors, company name)

## 8 CSA Pain Points & Playbooks

These are the most common challenges that drive partners to CloudRadial. Each maps to specific portal features and configuration steps.

### 1. Eliminate Email/Phone Tickets

**Problem:** End users email or call for support instead of using the portal.
**Solution:** Service catalog + ticket submission portal
**Configure:**
- Build an intuitive service catalog with clear categories
- Add catalog questions that capture required info upfront
- Set up email redirect (auto-reply pointing to portal)
- Create a "How to Submit a Ticket" KB article
- Add the portal URL to the company's email signature

### 2. Improve GAP Analysis

**Problem:** Hard to identify gaps in a client's IT environment.
**Solution:** Assessments + endpoint reporting + flexible assets
**Configure:**
- Deploy assessments (security, compliance, infrastructure)
- Review endpoint data for warranty gaps, OS distribution
- Set up flexible assets for tracking non-standard items
- Build a GAP analysis report template using assessment results

### 3. Improve Sales Presentations

**Problem:** QBRs and sales presentations lack data-driven insights.
**Solution:** Portal reporting + archive reports + endpoint data
**Configure:**
- Pull endpoint warranty expiration data for upsell opportunities
- Aggregate user adoption metrics for value demonstration
- Generate archive reports showing before/after metrics
- Use assessment scores to identify expansion opportunities

### 4. User Training & Adoption

**Problem:** End users don't know how to use IT resources effectively.
**Solution:** Courses + lessons + enrollment tracking
**Configure:**
- Create training courses (security awareness, software basics, company policies)
- Build course lessons with HTML content
- Assign courses to users (required vs. optional)
- Track enrollment and completion rates
- Create a "Final Exam" lesson for knowledge verification

### 5. Reduce QBR Preparation Time

**Problem:** QBR prep takes hours of manual data gathering.
**Solution:** Company overview + automated reporting
**Configure:**
- Use `company_overview` to get instant snapshots
- Set up automated archive reports
- Configure feedback collection for ongoing CSAT data
- Build a standard QBR checklist that pulls from portal data

### 6. Sync PSA & Microsoft 365

**Problem:** Data silos between PSA, M365, and client-facing portal.
**Solution:** Integration configuration (done in CloudRadial admin, not via API)
**Note:** PSA and M365 integrations are configured in the CloudRadial admin portal, not through this plugin. Guide partners to Settings → Integrations.

### 7. Onboarding/Offboarding Forms

**Problem:** New hire onboarding and employee offboarding are manual, error-prone processes.
**Solution:** Service catalog forms with structured questions
**Configure:**
- Create "New Employee Onboarding" catalog item with comprehensive questions (name, department, start date, software needs, hardware needs, access requirements)
- Create "Employee Offboarding" catalog item (last day, equipment return, access revocation checklist)
- Set up automation rules in PSA to create tasks from form submissions

### 8. Replace Invarosoft / DeskDirector

**Problem:** Partner is migrating from another client portal tool.
**Solution:** Full CloudRadial implementation matching/exceeding previous capabilities
**Configure:**
- Audit the existing portal's content and features
- Recreate service catalog items, KB articles, and branding
- Migrate user accounts
- Set up equivalent integrations
- Communicate the transition to end users with training content

## Content Seeding Workflows

### Seed Articles for a New Company

1. Identify the company and confirm companyId
2. Check existing articles to avoid duplicates
3. Create articles as drafts (isPublished: false) — call `create_resource` with:
   ```
   resource_type: "article"
   data: {
     companyId: <id>,
     subject: "Article Subject Here",
     body: "<p>HTML article content</p>",
     category: "Category Name",
     isPublished: false
   }
   ```
4. Review drafts with the partner before publishing
5. Publish by updating `isPublished: true`

### Seed a Training Course

1. Create the course container:
   ```javascript
   // create_resource with resource_type: "course"
   // Key fields: name, description (HTML), category, companyId, estimatedTime, isRequired, passScore
   ```
2. Create lessons in order:
   ```javascript
   // create_resource with resource_type: "course_lesson"
   // Key fields: courseId, title, overview, text (HTML body), order, companyId
   ```
3. Final Exam lesson is a stub — quiz mechanics handled by the platform

### Seed a Service Catalog

1. Create catalog items:
   ```javascript
   // create_resource with resource_type: "catalog"
   // Key fields: name, description, companyId
   ```
2. Add catalog questions for each item:
   ```java
