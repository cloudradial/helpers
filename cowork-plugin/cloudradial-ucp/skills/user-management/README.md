**Say this:**

```
Who has access to Contoso's portal?
```

## Try it

| Say this | What you get |
|---|---|
| `Find user john@acme.com` | User record with company, role, and last login |
| `Who has access to Contoso's portal?` | Full user list with names, emails, and roles |
| `How many users does Acme Corp have?` | Quick count by company |
| `List Contoso's users with just name, email, and role` | Filtered fields for a clean view |
| `Which of Contoso's users haven't completed security training?` | Cross-referenced with course enrollments |

## Good to know

- **`user_lookup` is the fast path** when you know the email, name, or company.
- **One user can appear in multiple companies** — lookup by email returns across all companies.
- **Pagination is automatic** for companies with thousands of users (API max 200 per page).
